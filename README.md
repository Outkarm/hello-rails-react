# Hello Rails React

Welcome to Hello Rails React! This is a sample Rails application that integrates React for frontend development. It demonstrates how to set up a Rails app with React, use react-router for routing, connect to a Rails API endpoint, and display data in a React component.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby (version 3.2.1)
- Node.js (version 18.16.0)
- Yarn (optional but recommended)
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
````

2. Install the required Ruby gems:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Install the required Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the Rails server:

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

### API Endpoint

The app includes an API endpoint that returns a random greeting from the `messages` table. The endpoint URL is:

```
GET /greetings/random
```

You can modify the greetings by updating the `messages` table in the database.

### Folder Structure

- `app/views`: Contains the views for the Rails app, including the `index.html.erb` layout file.
- `app/javascript/components`: Contains the React components, including the `App` and `Greeting` components.
- `app/javascript/packs`: Contains the JavaScript entry point files, including `index.js`.
- `config/routes.rb`: Defines the Rails routes, including the API route for the greetings endpoint.
- `babel.config.js`: Configuration file for Babel, used for transpiling JSX and ES6 code.
- `webpack.config.js`: Configuration file for Webpack, used for bundling JavaScript assets.
